Botnet Traffic Detection using Machine Learning
This project tackles the challenge of botnet traffic detection using the CTU-13 dataset and advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to distinguish between normal and botnet traffic in a highly imbalanced environment.

üìä Dataset Overview
Dataset Size: 2,824,636 network flow records

Columns: 15 original features including StartTime, Dur, Proto, SrcAddr, Sport, Dir, DstAddr, Dport, State, TotPkts, TotBytes, etc.

Target: Label (botnet vs. normal flow)

üîç Problem Characteristics
Type: Binary Classification (Normal vs. Botnet)

Challenge: Severe class imbalance (67.96:1)

Normal traffic: 2,783,675 samples

Botnet traffic: 40,961 samples

üßº Data Preprocessing
‚úÖ Missing Values
Sport, Dport, State, sTos, dTos had missing values.

Handled with conditional imputation and flags for missingness.

‚úÖ Feature Engineering
Created 30+ new features, including:

Time-based features: Hour, Minute, Second

Statistical features: Packet rate, Byte rate, Avg packet size, Variance

Categorical transformations: Encoded Dir, State, port categories, etc.

Binary flags: Is_TCP, Is_UDP, Is_short_connection, etc.

‚úÖ Feature Selection
Selected top 25 features based on importance using ensemble models.

‚öñÔ∏è Class Imbalance Handling
Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset:

Before: [Normal: 2,226,939 | Botnet: 32,769]

After: [Normal: 2,226,939 | Botnet: 2,226,939]

ü§ñ Model Development
Individual Models:
Model	ROC-AUC	PR-AUC	F1-Score	Precision	Recall
XGBoost	0.9992	0.9595	0.7074	0.5507	0.9888
LightGBM	0.9990	0.9507	0.6852	0.5246	0.9877
Random Forest	0.9980	0.8983	0.6213	0.4533	0.9872
Logistic Regression	0.9742	0.3499	0.2432	0.1397	0.9369

‚úÖ Ensemble Model
Averaged predictions from XGBoost, LightGBM, and RandomForest:

ROC-AUC: 0.9990

PR-AUC: 0.9497

F1-Score: 0.6858

Optimal threshold tuning achieved F1-Score = 0.88, Recall = 0.87, and Precision = 0.89 on botnet class.

üìà Evaluation (Test Set)
Accuracy: 99.9%

Botnet Detection:

Precision: 0.89

Recall: 0.87

F1-Score: 0.88

üìå Key Takeaways
Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance, which drastically improved botnet detection.

Feature engineering played a crucial role in increasing model performance.

Ensemble learning outperformed individual classifiers in both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC.

Optimal threshold tuning helped balance between false positives and false negatives.
